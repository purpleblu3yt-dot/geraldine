    <h1>My Favorite Kdramas</h1>
    <h2>Love Revolution</h2>
    <p>Love Revolution is one of my favorite Kdramas because it has a fun and lighthearted story about young love and friendship.
         <br>I like it because the characters are very relatable, and it shows the excitement and challenges of being a student while experiencing first love.</p>

         <h2>Weak Hero</h2>
         <p>Weak Hero is my favorite because of its inspiring storyline that shows courage and determination. 
            <br>I like it because the main character uses his intelligence and strategies instead of strength, which makes the fights more interesting and meaningful.</p>

            <h2>Study Group</h2>
            <p>Study Group is a Kdrama I enjoy because it mixes school life with action and determination. 
                <br>I like it because it shows how students face struggles not only in academics but also in life, 
                and how teamwork and perseverance can help overcome challenges.</p>
