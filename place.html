    <h1>My Favorite Place</h1>
    <h2>Cafe</h2>
    <p>Café is my favorite place because it has a cozy and relaxing atmosphere that makes me feel at peace. 
        I like spending time there because I can enjoy a cup of coffee or snacks while studying, working, or simply relaxing. 
       <br> The quiet background music and warm ambiance make it the perfect spot to focus or to spend time with friends.
         Being in a café gives me comfort and inspiration, which is why I enjoy going there so much.</p>
