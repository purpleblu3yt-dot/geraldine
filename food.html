    <h1>My Favorite Foods</h1>
   <br>
    <h2>Adobo</h2>
    <p>Adobo is one of my favorite dishes because of its rich, savory flavor that perfectly combines salty, tangy, 
        and sometimes a hint of sweetness. I like it because it’s very comforting and reminds <br> me of home-cooked meals with my family. 
        It’s also a versatile dish since you can use chicken, pork, or even both, and it still tastes amazing. 
        Eating adobo always makes me feel connected to Filipino culture and tradition.</p>

    <h2>Sinigang</h2>
    <p>Sinigang is one of my favorites because of its refreshing sour taste that makes it unique compared to other dishes. I like it because it’s comforting, 
        especially on rainy days, and it goes perfectly with hot rice. <br>The mix of vegetables, meat, and tamarind broth makes it both healthy and delicious. 
        It reminds me of family gatherings where everyone enjoys it together, which makes the dish extra special for me.</p>

    <h2>Tinola</h2>
    <p>Tinola is one of my favorite dishes because it has a light, comforting broth that feels very soothing, 
        especially when I’m not feeling well. I like it because the combination of chicken, green papaya or sayote, <br>and malunggay leaves makes it both healthy and delicious.
         The warm soup is perfect during cold or rainy days, and it always reminds me of home-cooked meals made with care.</p>
